                Though all Shadows by some degree are telepaths and have some psychic powers. The Spirit is in league of their own. At one point they were a human male, who 
                only goal in life was to learn everything. Though this was before he was given The Essence. Before that he was a boy stuck in his own mind. 
                He wanted to learn everything he could about the world he lived on. His only desire was to be like the heroes he saw in the movies. Forever powerful
                and invincible. He resented his mangled and useless body. 

            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Essence freed him from that way of life and gave The Spirit purpose in life. At last he was able to do what he always desired. Tho The Essence took away his natural human and 
                he became a being of pure energy, The Spirit did not care. The power it gave him allowed him to learn anything he could ever desire!

                Persephone disgusts The Spirit, at her disposal she has the power to change and make the galaxy a better place for all. Instead she uses it destroy
                and ruin it. The Spirit has taken it upon themselves to correct this evil wrong and bring peace to the galaxy at large. Even if they burn the galaxy
                with Persephone in it.
