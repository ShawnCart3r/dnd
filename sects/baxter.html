            <p class="paragraph">
                As a boy, Baxter always dreamed of traveling the cosmos and exploring alien worlds. He would look up at the Earth's night sky from his
                protective bubble. Due to his many illnesses, the Earth air could very well kill him. So he spent most of his young life in protective isolation. He longed for the day
                that his feet could feel the wet grass on his bare feet and the suns on his skin. When his parents heard about the miracle cure of The Essence. With an unheard of excitement,
                they put Baxter into the trial.

            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Essence did in fact do its job. Just not in the way Baxter intended. His mind had grown, as did his reflexes, and strength. His condition however,
                was amplified. He know could only live within a mech. His parents, thinking they failed him, left Baxter to the scientists. In truth Baxter 
                didn't blame them at all. He wouldn't have gone through the transformation without knowing the risks. From then on he began to utilize his current situation and become an authority
                in chemistry and other bio techs. 
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">In the present time, Baxter has become more machine than man. His fellow originals aren't sure if the boy that dreamed of feeling the grass beneath his feet
                 still in that machine. The bio weapons he's made have brought entire empires to their knees and killed millions more. Little do they know, Baxter only made them because Darkness, and now Theresa,
                 have ordered him to make them. All he ever wants to do is sit on the grass and enjoy the sun rays. Though all Baxter can do is watch from his confines of his prison
                 as he ruins the world he so desires to feel.

                As a follower of Baxter, you are a bio engineering expert. You look for the most creative and effect ways to eliminate large groups of enemies. Whether it is humane or not, matters little to you.
                For you the pursuit of knowledge trumps all. You are always eager to explore life and its uniqueness. The Nightmaric War has allowed you to explore the most destructive and monstrous side of your 
                chosen career. Much to the horror of the galaxy. When in this sect you get 1+ to intelligent and 1+ constitution.
