            <p class="paragraph">
                For most of her life, Zora was alone. She didn't have a family or any friends to connect too. The scientists found her malnourished in back alley way with a half empty
                soda can and a piece of stale bread. They took into the experiment, perhaps out of pity, or because if she died no one would miss her. Perhaps it was little
                of both, Zora never cared to ask. She was and is still grateful for the change they offered her.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The Essence granted her the ability to shapeshift, and excellent hearing. Though this came at the cost of eye sight. Zora could however see
                sound vibration. So she took that loss as a benefit instead. With her ability to blend in and go wherever she desired, Zora started to take up on contracts for assassinations. 
                She would take the form of long dead people, to make her untraceable and unknown. The mask was for to enhance her vibration seeing, and to cover her true face. Something she had begun
                to forget looked like. It wasn't long before Darkness found her and offered her a position in his grand plan. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Though Darkness grand plan was long done, the start of the Nightmaric War required Zora's specific talents. There will always be a need for a sniper or subtle blade in the dark
                to dispatch someone high valued traitor or Nightmaric General. Zora does not care, just long as the pay is good and she can get the sweetest drink at the bar afterward.
