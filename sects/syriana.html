                Syriana, "The Red Terror", "The Whirl Wind of Death", "The Bringer of Annihilation " just to list a few her nicknames given to her
                in her years plaguing the galaxy. Of The Seven, she is the most blood thirsty and most eager to murder whoever stands in her way. Even before her
                transformation, she had murderous tendencies that could not be overlooked. Her parents made the unfortunate decision of locking her away in an asylum with the 
                vain hope of helping her.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Seeing a rare opportunity to test The Essence, the doctors injected it into Syriana, hoping against hope that it will change her for the better.
                Instead The Essence amplified Syriana's murderous instincts, gave her godlike reflexes, and the thirst for blood. Within hours every living soul
                in the asylum was dead. Their mangled bodies laid strewn around for all to see. Syriana, caked in blood, took pride in her work as she overlooked it. So much so, she
                hadn't sense or felt the dart that knocked her out cold. The last thing she saw was a woman in blank mask walking towards before her world went dark.

            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Since that time Syriana has calmed down and kept her most sadistic tendencies in check. Though The Nightmaric War has all but allowed her to tap into them once more.
                Syriana now had an enemy who could stand up to her and above all welcomed the slaughter. She was all to pleased to oblige them. In every battlefield and in every front, where ever one can see a tidal wave
                blood and mangled appendages, you can be assured Syriana will be suffering on it cackling with madness and grin that would cause the most
                harden killer to step back in disgust.

                In Syriana's sect, you are all to eager to taste the blood of your enemies. Just witnessing your victims life slip away from their eyes makes you ecstatic.
                Like your Syriana, you enjoy the break neck life of style of close combat. Where one bad decision can lead to your death. For you there is no better feeling than
                out playing your opponent. Your only desire is wreck havoc and make your victim rue the day they crossed your path. If you choose Syriana's sect, you get d8 to your agility and d6 intimidation.
