                The Matriarch of the Shadows. An enigma of woman. Some see her as their lady and savior, other the destruction of all
                human life. Before her forced dark coronation, Theresa was nicked named The Blue Saint. During that time she was a kind and warm hearted hero
                of the people. She would go out of her way to save the most ailing, human or otherwise. From her point no one deserved to suffer silence. Where ever she went,
                hope blossomed around Theresa. Moral would improve and soldiers would find their second to take the fight back to the enemy. How and why Theresa had this effect
                on people bewildered everyone, and but they didn't complain regardless. Then The Battle of Solphis 6 happened.
                <p class="paragraph">
                It was a conclusion to an already very bad week for the Shadows and their human allies. Persephone had played her trump card and shattered the status quo of 
                the galaxy forever. With the galaxy cut in half and the Nightmares gaining more territory by the day, drastic action needed to be taken. Theresa and Darkness 
                had decided to commit to an alpha strike against Persephone and shatter her fledgling empire. Gathering the rest of The Original 7, Theresa and her siblings struck out
                to end the conflict before it grew to devour the entire galaxy.

                    The details about what transpired on Solphis 6 are few and far between. From what historians can peace together, it was a devastating
                    engagement for both side. Shadows, being notorious at keeping their allies at a need to know basis, have kept what happened all to themselves.
                    All that everyone knows is that Theresa and Darkness teleported together with a legion  of the 7 sects elites behind them. Only half that number returned. In front of them sat a blood drenched Theresa
                    cradling the limp body of Darkness. Some say she was whispering something that few could understand, none of the Shadows dare to confirm or deny that. What was confirmed however was how Theresa
                    demeanor changed. The Theresa that had teleported to the ground had died, what came back was unrecognizable.

                    <p class="paragragh">
                        Since her dark coronation, Theresa attitude had changed. No longer was she cheerful and optimistic. Her aura of positivity no longer emanated from her presence.
                        Now whenever she joins the fray her allies only feel a cold rage build within them and sudden urge for blood filled vengeance. She dives into combat and slaughters hundreds, it assured one thing is on Theresa mind.
                        Death comes for all, and she'll burn galaxy to the ground.
