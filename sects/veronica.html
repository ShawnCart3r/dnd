            <p class="paragraph">
                Unlike the rest of her war hungry peers, Veronica has no taste for violence. Before her transformation, she was the daughter of wealthy parents who were respected by all.
                Though their only daughter was challenged mentally, they did their damndest to have her live a normal life. When The Essence was invented, Veronica's parents pulled every string
                they could find to put her in the trials. The results did not disappointment them.  
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Perhaps it was her up bring or The Essence just agreed with her. Veronica, beyond her mind being cured of it ailment, had left her unchanged. She was still the same whimsicle lady who
                enjoyed everything life had given her. In no time she got several doctorates and even became lawyer just for kicks. Veronica did all this, so she could aid her parent race
                in becoming a better version of herself.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                The Nightmaric War has forced Veronica to confront her most terrible truths. War will always be part for dna, whether she ever wanted to admit it or not.
                Persephone is the antithesis of everything she stands for and must be destroyed. Though her parents are long dead, Veronica always kept the promise she made to them all those years ago.
                Don't let the cruelty of world get to you. Preserver and always do better. Veronica would be lying if she said that was becoming more and more easier said than done.
