        <div class="synopsis">
            <p class="paragraph">Darkena is known as the Lady of Stone. Her will is unbreakable and as relentless as she is cunning. She'll lead from the front
                and take the fight to the enemy. She'll often be found in thickest of the fighting. Her joyous laughter overtaking the loudest of death screams.
                Her preferred mode of combat is mid range combat.Always eager to be the first one into the fight and last out. Being armored, she can take hits that would
                fell most mortals. Darkena takes it upon herself to defend the weak from those that wish to end their existence.  
                <p class="paragraph">

                few know of course she is new comer into the war. The previous head of the sect, Darkness, had been laid low by Persephone. 
                 Before the war, she had been recluse. Enjoying her immortal life at the swankest resort worlds one could find. Darkena noticed a change
                in people's demeanor, even before word of Darkness's fall got to her. There were less and less people at the resorts Darkena went to.
                It didn't bother her at all since she wasn't  much of a people person to begin with. It was Theresa arrival that solidified how dire things had become. 
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                 What got her attention was the young brunette who trailed behind her, but could not place why she felt and looked familiar. The Saint, as always,
                 looked less than pleased to be in even in Darkena's presence. The two hadn't left at the greatest of terms all those years ago. After ordering drinks for herself and her
                 new friends, Darkena took a breath and listened to what Theresa had to say. She would go on to explain that galaxy as of right now was split down the middle,
                 and that news was down playing things at her request. As she rambled on, Darkena continued to look at the brunette who sat across her in silence as she drank her beverage.
                 Why Theresa brought this young woman with her puzzled her. Was she meant to pull at her strings and have join this clusterfuck of a war? The thought of that offended darkena.
                 Cassandra, was what the woman had told her before their drinks had arrived. After for what felt like an eternity, Theresa finished and went on to ask Darkena if she would 
                 join the war effort. Darkena looked at both of them for a few minutes while deciding. 

              </p>

              <p class="paragraph">
                  Before Darkena could say no, Cassandra spoke. As the great grand daughter of the original seven, she saw it as her duty to amended sins of the past
                 and to rectify the mistakes that were made. She understood Darkena's relectance to rejoining the war effort, but reminded her that the war would reach a resort
                 like this in time. Flabbergasted at the audacity of Cassandra, Darkena was rendered speechless. Darkena loathed that she had a point though. Kind of hard to hide out
                 on a world that was consumed by war. With great reluctance, Darkena said yes to Theresa. 
              </p> 
              <p class="paragraph">
                  Now instead of drinking exotic beverages on a sunny beach, Darkena can be found dropping into the thickest of the fighting with vain hope of her returning
                  to her previous life of solitude and excessive amount of drinking.

                In Darkena's sect, you are a warrior who enjoys being in the thick of things, but also enjoy the protection of your armor to 
                take hits that would slay most mortals. You are always the first into a fight and your companions will have to drag you out of a fight before you even begin to admit defeat. 
                For ranged, your preferred weapons of choice are either a shot gun or an assault rifle. As for close combat, you're fine with a rock or any debris this is near you. If your character
                has psychic potential your mere presence can break even the most resilient opponents by twisting and using their minds against them.  If you choose The Barbarian class, you get 2+ strength. If the Fighter is chosen, you get 1+ strength and 1+ dexterity. 
                if Oathbreaker is chose, you get 1+ intelligents and 1+ strength.
