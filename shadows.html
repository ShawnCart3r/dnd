        <div class="synopsis">
            <p class="paragraph">An elite group of super soldiers created by mankind during the mid 21st century. They are soldiers of incredible, strength, intellect, and perseverance. Entire worlds have fallen to just a mere handful of them. Wherever they are deployed, destruction and death are not far behind. However, Shadows always go out of their to make the world better than it was when they got there. They divided into seven separate sects, but are controlled by one when needed. 
                All Shadows are equal and deserve to command one another at any given moment. Only a member of the Original Seven can supersede an order of another Shadow. In the onset of The Nightmaric, The Shadows have welcomed other races to their ranks. They say it was for equal opportunity, but those that understand how the Shadow's think, know better.
                With Persephone's forces growing with newer threats everyday, The Shadow's needed to adapt and learn the weakness of their new threats. What better way than to open recruitment to other races of the galaxy?
                 </p>
                 <p class="paragraph">
                     The stakes however, have never been higher. Everyday worlds are falling to Persephone's dark control, and many systems are seceding to her in 
                     the false hope of safety. Whether out of fear or the promise of power, it doesn't matter to the Shadows. They primary goal since onset of the war has been to return the system to
                     humanities control and purge Persephone's influence from it.

                 </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    As The Shadows, you'll be thrust into the most desperate of situations. Often times you'll jump into a front in full retreat or you'll have to persuade a system not
                    join Persephone. What you do and how you do it will effect your relationships with the local populace the government. In the end all that matters is that all life continues to live
                    and prosper. No matter the cost.
